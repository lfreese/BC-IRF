### Create a pulse run

In order to create a pulse run, use the 'prep_pulses' notebook, importing the file of interest to pulse, selecting the region of interest for the pulse. Add a reasonable amount relative to the existing emissions amounts. When running GEOS-Chem modify the normal file to read in the new one instead via HEMCO_Config.
